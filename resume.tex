  % Projects
  \section{Projects}
    \cvline{The Jedi Academy}{\httpslink[www.thejediacademy.net]{www.thejediacademy.net}, This was my first major project, an online community that taught how to play the online games Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and Star Wars: Jedi Academy. It's defunct now, but at its peak in 2004 it was an online community with over 10,000 active users and was featured in PC Gamer UK. It was built from the ground up in PHP with news feeds, forums, commenting systems, online class scheduling and attendance, student/instructor hierarchies, and limited game server interactivity. Working on this site and with this community gave me my career. The skills I learned here got noticed by the right people and pulled me out of the tech support world into software development. I've made life-long friends, and the community management skills I learned here have carried into my professional life. Some day I'll re-implement this site using modern best practices.}
    \cvline{Occupy Houston}{\httpslink[www.occupyhouston.org]{web.archive.org/web/20111004234028/http://occupyhouston.org/} (via archive.org), I was a core organizer in the Occupy Houston movement, a local offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street political movement. I was their primary IT person and responsible for maintaining the website, content, note taking, social media, mailing lists, document storage, internet access in the camp, and comunication with other local Occupy movements. I helped organize marches and rallies attended by hundreds of people and facilitated many of our general assemblies. Occupy Houston taught me about consensus-based decision making, working with diverse groups of people, large scale coordination, and informed me on a number of political, social, and economic issues.}
    \cvline{The Organization for Ethical Source}{\httpslink[ethicalsource.dev]{ethicalsource.dev}, I'm proud to work as an operations volunteer and administrator for the Ethical Source movement. I assist working groups in deployments, project hosting, and other operational needs. We're a diverse team of technologists, scholars, researchers, and lawyers, and I learn something new from them every day.}
