Kevin Laude's Resume
====================
I wanted a decent excuse to mess around with LaTeX. Working on my resume seemed like a good enough reason. Keeping it in this repository also makes it easier for me to find and keep up to date.

I created a custom style and graphics to make the GitHub and LinkedIn links in the header, otherwise it uses the excellent and crisp [moderncv](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) style and is very loosely based on moderncv's [example file](http://ctan.unixbrain.com/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/examples/template.tex). I've tested this to compile on [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org) in Windows and [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) in Ubuntu. I may test it on other operating systems and editors later.

The version in this repository does not contain my home address or mobile phone number. If you're interested please contact me directly. I'll get you a PDF version with my current contact information.
