Kevin Laude's Resume
====================
I wanted a decent excuse to mess around with LaTeX. Working on my resume seemed like a good enough reason. Keeping it in this repository also makes it easier for me to find and keep up to date.

I created a custom style and graphics to make the GitHub and LinkedIn links in the header, otherwise it uses the excellent and crisp [moderncv](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) style and is very loosely based on moderncv's [example file](http://ctan.unixbrain.com/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/examples/template.tex). I've only tested this to compile in [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org). I may test it on other operating systems and editors later.
