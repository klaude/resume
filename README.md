# Kevin Laude's Resume

I wanted an excuse to mess around with LaTeX, and working on my resume seemed like a good enough reason. Keeping it in this repository also makes it easier for me to find and keep it up to date.

My resume uses the excellent and crisp [moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) style and is loosely based on moderncv's [example file](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv/blob/master/examples/template.tex). I've tested this to compile on [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org) in Windows and [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) in Linux. I may test it on other operating systems and editors later.

The version in this repository does not contain mobile phone number. If you're interested please contact me directly. I'll get you a PDF version with my current contact information.
